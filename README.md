# Goal-Setter App: This is an application that I built to test my understanding of building full-stack applications. 
## It is the first in the series of 5, where I will build the backend API from scratch implementing authentication and CRUD before delving deeply into BaaS.

### Goal Setter Application Features

* Login - Authentication using JWT and Bcrypt and Session Storage to persist login stage until signed out
* Form states managed by React + Redux Tool Kit
* Database- MongoDB to store user goals

### How to run the application
* First clone the repository on your machine
* Run **npm install** to install all the necessary dependencies
* You might need to go to MongoDB and set the env variables used in the backend folder
* When you think you're done, open your terminal and hit ** npm run dev** to run both frontend and backend concurrently
